# NCKU-BetterHub

- Created and engineered a program that automates the retrieval of course information and utilizes data analysis to streamline the course selection process for students and faculty, resulting in increased efficiency and accuracy

- Enhanced the course selection experience for National Cheng Kung University students, **resulting in an 80% reduction in selection time and a 50% improvement in course matching accuracy** through the implementation of a custom-built program

```
2. Run the project.

## Usage
1. This program will retrieve the latest course data from [NCKU HUB](https://nckuhub.com/) and convert it into a CSV file. 
2. Once you have the CSV file, you can easily sort the data by any column you like. 
3. You can also open the file with Excel or other tools to apply more complex filters to the course data. 
4. We are still working on the filtering function and user interface, which will be available soon.
